  Whats for dinner? - she's got a few favorites, so ask often!
  Where are you now? - She's a cat, so she sure does roam.... She probably can portal from one state to the other in seconds as well...

  #PickLock Game
  start game - to read the rules and start playing Vivi's favourite game.
     @vivibot - if you aren't in a private session

  tries # - replace # with any number you fancy, to set your prefs for the game.

  pick ##### - replace # with your 5 guessed digits to start guessing


# PickLock game rules - as explained by Vivi herself.
  My precious lock consist of five consecutive single numbers,
  You're job is to pick the lock and guess all five digits correctly
  When I say "lock xxxxx"
  You're answer should start with the word "pick" followed by five numbers
  Example: "pick 12345"
  When the right number is at the right position
  "x" will turn to "o", that means you have unlocked one of the digits...
  I'm very generous, so if you have got one of the numbers right, but it's not in the right spot, you'll get a "-" as a tiny hint
  Example: "lock xoxo-"

  Oh yeah, I won't tell you if a digit appears more than once in my lock combination though,
  happy picking!

  You will know when you have guessed all five digits, as you would have unlocked my secret happy gifs...

# Set PickLock game tries - as explained by Vivi herself.
  Now tell me how many tries would you like to have?
  Reply by typing a number then tries
  Like such "tries 5"
